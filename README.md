FISH600 stock assessment simulation study
===============================================



This repository serves the **FISH 600** Stock Assessment Research Team from the [School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences](http://fish.washington.edu/) (SAFS) at The University of Washington. The FISH600 team is conducting a large-scale simulation estimation study aligned with the aims of the [World Conference on Stock Assessment Methods 2013](http://www.ices.dk/news-and-events/symposia/WCSAM-2013/Pages/default.aspx) (WCSAM) workshop and simulation program. The team has built operating and stock assessment models using [Stock Synthesis](http://nft.nefsc.noaa.gov/SS3.html) (SS) to represent cod-like, flatfish-like, and sardine-like fisheries, and is using those models to investigate questions that relate directly to the 'grand questions' proposed by the WCSAM organisers.

The FISH 600 team consists of staff and students from SAFS; NOAA's Alaskan, North West, and South West Fisheries Science Centers; and some visiting students from The University of Brittish Columbia and Simon Fraser University. More details on the team and project can be found [here](https://github.com/awhitten/fish600/blob/master/ICES_Articles_Summary.md). The team is currently developing, and using, an R Package for conducting stock assessment simulation studies using Stock Synthesis 3. The package is maintained by [Sean Anderson](https://github.com/seananderson/ss3sim) and is freely available.
