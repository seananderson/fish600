### A stock assessment simulation study ###

This repository serves the **FISH 600** Stock Assessment Research Team based at the [School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences](http://fish.washington.edu/) (SAFS) at The University of Washington. The FISH600 team is conducting a large-scale simulation estimation study aligned with the aims of the [World Conference on Stock Assessment Methods 2013](http://www.ices.dk/news-and-events/symposia/WCSAM-2013/Pages/default.aspx) (WCSAM) workshop and simulation program. The team consists of researchers and post-graduate students from The University of Washington, [The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Marine Fisheries Service](http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/) (NOAA Fisheries), The University of British Columbia, and Simon Fraser University. 

The team has built operating and stock assessment models using [Stock Synthesis 3](http://nft.nefsc.noaa.gov/SS3.html) (SS3) to represent cod-like, flatfish-like, and sardine-like fisheries, and is using those models to investigate questions that relate directly to the 'grand questions' proposed by the WCSAM organisers. The team is also developing, and using, an R Package for conducting stock assessment simulation studies using SS3. The package, currently in beta mode, is maintained by [Sean Anderson](https://github.com/seananderson/ss3sim) and will be made publicly available later in 2013.
