# Abstract #

Stock assessment simulation studies are critical to evaluating stock assessment methods and understanding their strengths and weaknesses. This paper briefly summarises current trends in stock assessment simulation and describes the key components and steps necessary to conduct efficient and effective simulations using contemporay fisheries stock assessment methods. This paper also describes key outcomes of a series of large-scale stock assessment simulation studies and outlines important lessons learned from them.


# Introduction #

Stock assessment simulation is key to evaluating stock assessment methods and understanding their strengths and weaknesses. <!-- Modellers need to make assumptions, and these can have consequences for the outputs of stock assessments. [See thesis for text on model assumptions and testing those] --> Simulation is important because it enables modellers to test assessment models on known truths, to examine the consequences of alternative plausible truths, and to match (or mismatch) truths and assessment model assumptions. 

The results of simulation studies should, in principle, permit a general understanding of the behaviour of methods and models under examination, but because results are dependent on 

For this reason, simulation studies must be designed and implemented with careful consideration of the desired outcomes. That is, they should address specific questions, and be

As the 'true' dynamics and properties of fish stocks can almost never be known with certainty, simulation modelling is one of the most effective ways to investigate how a fish stock might reposnd to fishing. Hilborn and Walters (REF), suggest testing via simulation modelling should be prerequsitie for all stock assessment methods before they are applied in practice, but in reality this is rarely the case. Simple models were frequenlty tested by simulation in the past (REFS), but as stock assessment have become increasingly complex, so too have the computational demands and time requirements of simulation studies. With these added constraints, a proliferation of new stock assessment methods (REF) has not been met with equal numbers of simualtion studies to test and critique them. However, with continued improvements in computing power, and the availability of 'off the shelf' <!-- see Maunder and Punt for better words --> stock assessment modelling software, the ability to conduct rapid and effective stock assessment simulation studies is increasinlgy viable. 

Stock assessment simulation studies can be simple: testing direct estimation methods on example or simulated data sets specific to the method being examined (Example REFS); intermediate, with a focus on methods (as here), and all the way up to management strategy evaluation tpye studies (with examples). <!-- Insert text here about how simulation studies of constemporary statistical stock assessment (IA) models have become more comment in recent times, and refs to papers that have done this. Show that the models came a long time before the sim studies, and so sim studies need to catch up! -->. 

In this paper, we review current trends in simulation with contemporary fisheries stock assessment models, outline the necessary components for conducting stock assessment simulations, and share simple rules and key lessons learned whilst conducting a series of large-scale stock assessment simulation studies. 



# Stock assessment studies in practice #



<!-- Examples from the literature --> 



# Key components of effective simulation studies #

An effective stock assessment simulation requires four key components (Fig. 1):

1. A **conditioning model** is used to ground a stock assessment simulation to some plausible reality. A stock assessment simulation may be conditioned on a specific region and/or fish stock or on some generic representation of a fishery based on published literature, stock assessment reports, or expert opinion.

2. An **operating model** represents a range of conditions believed to underly the dynamics of a fish stock and fishery: It describes an assumed true state of nature, and true state of play. An operating model might specify, for example, that fish natural mortality  rates vary through time with some random walk, or that it is constant through time. It might also specify that fish are or some particular age are caught by one fishing fleet but not another, i.e. that different fleets exhibit different fishing selectivity.

3. *Pseudo-data* is sampled from an operating model with simulated observaton error in a manner that is representative of a fishing fleet or survey program of interest. 

4. A stock assessment *estimation model* is fit to the pseudo-data. This determines the ability of the methods of interest to estimate the parameters specified in the operating model, and to assess the scenario or 'status' of the simulated stock.

Steps 2 to 4 are usually repeated across iterations, with added re-sampled process error and observation error for each iteration. Blocks of iterations are repeated across multiple scenarios, with each scenario representing some different combination of conditioning, operating, sampling, and estimation models. This process differs from a management strategy evaluation in that MSE 'closes the loop' â€” introducing management decision rules about how to act on stock assessment outcomes that affect subsequent realistations of operating model years. Stock assessment simulation on the other hand is intended to examine the mechanics and performance of stock assessment models themselves: it allows modellers to investigate 


# Simple rules for stock assessment simulation studies #

Stock assessment simulation studies should be conducted with three 'Rs' in mind: *realism*, *relevance*, and *reproducability*. Simulation studies should be realistic, that is, conducted in a manner that is reflective of real fisheries situations, and using methods that are alligned with, or slightly progressive of, current modelling trends. Though it can be tempting to test all possible combinations and permutations of life history dynamics, and to test vastly new methods, it is better to consider population dynamics that fall within the realms of published or observed limits, and to test methods that are widely accepted and in common use. This strategy should help to ensure simulation results are relevant. Though relevance will ultimately be determined by whether results and recommendations eminating from a simulation study are read by an author's peers and cited in future work, it is important that any simulation study ensure relevance to current trends and the needs of the research community. Finally, simulation studies that are fully reproducable are most likley to have an impact on future research ... <!-- Something from paper on Reproducable Research here, and a reference to that -->

With the three R's as a recurring theme, we offer the following general 'rules' for conducting effective and efficient stock assessment simulation studies:

## 1. Choose widely-used, contemporary assessment models and methods ##

Stock assessment simulation studies are most relevant to current research and management if they utilise and analyse models and tools that are used in practice. In our studies we chose to focus on SS, which is a widely used integrated-assessment modelling framework, now used for a large number of stock assessments on the west coast of the United States and in the south east of Austrlia. 

When researchers are interested in multiple modelling frameworks they may choose between (1) conducting a study where both the OM and EM are based on the same modelling framework to better understand issues related to model specification or (2) conducting a study where the OM and EM are based on different modelling frameworks to investigate the impact of model-choice uncertainty. Frequently, model-choice uncertainty may dwarf other sources of uncertainty (REF).


## 2. Condition the operating model carefully ##
The relevance of a stock assessment simulation study depends on the system that the OM is conditioned to reflect. Researchers must choose between specific conditioning, in which the OM might be conditioned for specific species, region, or even stock and (2) generic conditioning in which the OM is conditioned on a general representation of a system. Both types of conditioning have their place in stock assessment simulation but each has its pros and cons. Specific conditioning may result in findings that are relevant to a specific species, region, or stock and may therefore be more likely accepted than generically conditioned models. Generic conditioning, however, may result in findings that are applicable across a wider range of fisheries, but are less applicable to any one stock.

## 3. Consider likely or important model misspecifications ##
Model misspecification refers to a mismatch between the truth (OM) and our assessment of that truth (EM). 
For example, an OM might specify time-varying M, whereas the EM might assume a constant M. Researchers might deem some forms of model misspecification more likely *a priori* and some types of model misspecification potentially more influential for stock assessment. It is these forms of model misspecification that researchers should focus on first.

## 4. Use a reproducible and transparent framework ##
To produce credible science, it is critical that stock assessment simulation studies are reproducible and transparent. Simulation studies written in a commonly used and widely supported programming languages are likely to be far more reproducable and accessible than studies conducted by clicking on buttons in a graphical user interface (GUI). Further, researchers might consider writing their code in a formal package or library structure (e.g. Anderson et al. 2013 R package). This makes it easier for future users to understand the code and simulation structure and encourages the code authors to document their work. 
Researchers can introduce further transparency by developing their code in a version control system such as Git, which provides a history of all code modifications (e.g. https://github.com/seananderson/ss3sim). Finally, by controlling model runs through plaintext control files, researchers and other users can easily understand and reproduce the settings that created their simulations.

## 5. Design a flexible framework ##
A stock assessments simulation framework is most useful if it is flexible for the current users as well as for future users who may develop scientific questions with the framework that the original users never considered. One way researchers can make their framework flexible is to build their code around smaller functions that can be mixed as needed. Another key element is keeping the input and output files in formats that can be read and process multiple tools (e.g. comma-separated, or tab-delimited text files). 
Finally, researchers may consider splitting scenarios into different cases so that cases can need mixed and matched into scenarios. 
For example, a scenario might be comprised of a combination of cases for the M trajectory, F trajectory, and selectivity patterns.  
If these cases are specified in individual text control files then they can be flexibly combined without duplicating case specification.

## 6. Check and test models early and often ##
The complexity of conducting stock assessment simulations means that the chance of making mistakes is high, and our ability to make sense of complicated model output can be limited. 
Deterministic model checking is therefore vital. 
To check a model deterministically we can reduce or eliminate process and observation error and check for bias between the OM and EM models. 
This might mean running the stock assessment simulation with minimal stock-recruit deviations and minimal observation error on survey indices.

An important component to model checking is graphical model checking. 
Many complex problems are unlikely to be detected without graphical model checking (REFs, maybe Gelman). 
To facilitate model checking these graphics should be rapid and easy to produce. 
We found the visualization packages `manipulator`, `shiny`, and `ggplot2` to be helpful for this purpose.

## 7. Keep simulation runtime minimal ##
To discover problems with your simulation and to understand how your simulations are performing you need to run them repeatedly under a variety of conditions. 
In addition to using a fast computer and writing code carefully, you can minimize runtime by reducing the number of scenarios and iterations. 
To reduce scenarios, a researcher might consider creating a base-case model and investigating deviations from that model instead of a full factorial design. 
To reduce iterations, a researcher can inspect test runs with an increasing number of iterations to determine the minimum number of iterations for study conclusions to converge.


## Other thoughts

* Keep folder structure as simple as possible; keep all output; write code so the simulations can be distributed across cores, computers, and researchers. Using a remote repository service such as Github (https://github.com) can make collaboration among researchers 

And other findings from published studies. 


# Discussion and conclusions #

We've arrived at the lessons we suggest in this paper after conducting a series of large-scale stock assessment simulation studies at the University of Washington. These studies are featured in this issue: 

Johnson et al. (2013, this issue) evaluated the ability of Stock Synthesis (SS) to estimate key quantities when a known 'true' natural mortality (M) was age-specific or age-invariant, but time-varying. Stock assessment methods included models with age-invariant pre-specified M, age-invariant estimated M, and age-specific estimated M. Ono et al. (2013, this issue) analysed the ability of SS to estimate management metrics for different life-history types (demersal, long-lived pelagic, and short-lived pelagic) when the same quantity and quality of pseudo-data were used to inform assessment models. They also considered whether the frequency and duration of length- and age-composition data, or catch history, affect the bias or precision of estimates of management quantities for different life-history types. Hurtado Ferro et al. (2013, this issue) investigated factors which lead to retrospective patterns in SCAA models. Specifically, they tested how key biological and modelling factors can induce retrospective patterns for various life history types. They explored the potential effects of catch patterns, as well as model miss-specification from time-varying biological parameters, time-varying selectivity and catchability, and their interactions. In those cases where retrospective patterns were observed, they assessed the utility of including time-varying selectivity in the assessment as a means to correct them. 

If a simulation study should be designed with the three 'Rs' in mind, then its success can me measured by the same criteria. Our studies were relevant: x,y, ; realistic, reproducability.
